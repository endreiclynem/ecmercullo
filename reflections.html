            <p>When we talk about love, people generally think of having 'the one' or having their 'perfect half'. Technically speaking, love is not just limited to the definition of having a grilfriend or the perfect girl that you would want to be with for eternity, but it is defined in so many ways. But I would want to ponder on one side of love.<br>
            <br>
            It is the undying love of Jesus for us. it says in John 3:16 that "For God so loved the world, he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not persih, but have eternal life. This bible verse indeed struck me and reminded me of how vast is Jesus' love for us. Even though we have turned our backs from him, even though we commit the same mistakes over and over again, Jesus is the only person that will keep running to us and hug us and will tell us that "I HAVE FORGIVEN YOU".<br>
            <br>
            It is overwhelming to imagine how great is his love for us because, as humans, we are not perfectly like him. A little flaw would make us go crazy. But let us be reminded of his love. May we learn to love others as we love him regardless of our neighbor's background or image. Everyone is not perfect. They commit mistakes as we do. But, remember the very essence of our faith, we must love others as we love God because whatever we do to the least of our brothers and sisters, we also do it to God. Sometimes, love may be hard to ponder on. Just hold onto him and everything wil be easy. </p>
