            <p>To my Dearest Parents, <br>
            <br>
            Since the day that I was born, you gave me a life that would lead me to my bright future. Staring my gradeschool years, you let me enter a wonderful private school even though during the entrance exam, I didn't pass the cut-off score. You managed to talk to the principal to let me be enrolled in the school. As years go by, I had several downs during my gradeschool years and yet, you motivated me to improve myself until my highschool years came. I gained a lot of awards and recognitions out of my efforts, out of my sleepless nights trying to finish papers and submit on time, out of the times when I cannot concentrate on things because of certain problems, still nothing can break me apart. When graduation came, I cannot imagine how happy you are for me because of my hardships that bore successes. I always say to myself, how lucky I am to have great parents like you.
            <br>
            <br>
            Despite of my "<i>kakulitan</i>", you were filled with a lot of patience I must say. Sometimes, I just want to say that I want to be me sometimes. I want to go places to seek refuge and to reflect on certain aspects of life. Thank you for guiding me and giving a life that I will never forget. Thank you for providing me everything and for working so hard. I love you, my dear parents from the bottom of my heart. No words can express my love for all the things that you have done for me.
            <br>
            <br>
            Love, <br>
            Your loving son.</p>
